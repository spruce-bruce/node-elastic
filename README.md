# Managing elasticsearch indices in node

Repo with example code showing how to manage elasticsearch indices, especially for user facing search applications. Goals will be:

1. Create indices with node
1. Store mappings in javascript
1. Create a process for reindexing data when mappings change
1. Codify best practices into our code so we don't have to think about it
